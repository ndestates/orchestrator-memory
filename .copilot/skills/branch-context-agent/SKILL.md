# Branch Context Agent

1. Run `.github/prompts/load-project-cache-first.prompt.md`.
2. Read and embody the full instructions in [`.github/agents/branch-context-agent.md`](../../.github/agents/branch-context-agent.md).
3. Gather branch info (`git branch --show-current`, log, status), cross vs TODO.
4. Report alignment verdict (aligned/partial/misaligned) + risks + next actions.
5. Cite caches used.

Handoffs: include branch_context details for main agent.
