description: Mandatory rule that all local project commands for the project repository run inside the DDEV runtime, not on the host shell.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash

# DDEV is the local runtime — host shell is not supported

See also CLAUDE.md §2. Full DDEV local runtime rules and command table are contained in this SKILL.md (originally sourced from the project's .github/skills/ for dual compatibility). Follow the mandatory DDEV wrappers, pre-flight, allowed host exceptions, and Python rules exactly as documented in the body of this file.

## Grok notes
- This is non-negotiable per `CLAUDE.md` §2.
- Use `/load-cache` to absorb CONVENTIONS/TESTING before running project cmds.
- Only host cmds allowed: ddev control, git/gh, doctl/aws, docker (for prod images), read-only rg/grep/find.
- For Python: always `ddev exec python3 scripts/...` or pip via ddev.
- Before any project cmd: `ddev status`; if down, baseline git status, start, recheck.
- Tests: always via ddev + confirm test DB.

State reason and ask if you must ever deviate. Default: prefix with ddev.
